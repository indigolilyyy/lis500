                <p>Hi, I'm a junior studing Graphic Design and Information Science. I'm currently obsessed with matcha lattes and I love to draw and paint. As someone who grew up as an artist on the internet, I've always been interested in how bias has been encoded into the social media platforms I spend so much time on. I look forward to hearing more from underrepresented voices in tech.</p>

                <p>Hello! I’m Haku, and I’m a senior majoring in computer science. I love traveling to new places and trying different foods because it allows me to immerse myself in different cultures. I decided to take this class because I’ve never really thought about the connection between code and power, and I’m excited to learn how they intersect.</p>
