<!-- Implicit Bias Test -->
<main class="main-content">
    <section class="intro">
        <p>Implicit bias denotes the unconscious attitudes or stereotypes that affect our choices and interactions, frequently operating without our knowledge. 
            The Implicit Bias Test (IBT) serves to help individuals identify these concealed biases, fostering self-examination and awareness. 
            Intersectionality, a concept put forth by Kimberlé Crenshaw, underscores how intersecting identities—like race, gender, and class—result in intricate patterns of privilege and discrimination.</p>

        <h4>What is the Harvard IAT?</h4>
        <p>The Harvard IAT measures the strength of associations between concepts and stereotypes or judgements, like a strong association of “women” with “family” versus “men” with “career.” </p>
        <h4>Discussion:</h4>
        <p>The tool and the researchers that created it use the verbiage – “automatic preference”, to shift away from using the tool as a concrete way to determine implicit bias or racism. 
            At the time of this <a href="https://www.vox.com/identities/2017/3/7/14637626/implicit-association-test-racism">Vox</a> article, author German Lopez says there is “no clear disclaimer about how one shot at the test is likely meaningless for predicting an individual’s bias and behavior.” 
            When I recently took the IAT, it was clearly stated on the site that the test once does not accurately predict future behaviors. The usefulness of the IAT had shifted over time, 
            and many believe it hasn’t lived up to its promises. However, the activity prompts introspection on potential implicit biases that people may be unaware of, which, 
            even if not indicative of future behavior, is still helpful. </p>

                Intersectionality</a>
            <p>While Shapiro paints a lazy, pessimistic picture of intersectionality, it provides a clear demonstration of how the topic can be misconstrued and portrayed negatively.</p>

        <p>The DiAngelo reading is a wonderful guide on discussing white fragility. The first section is dedicated to providing instructions on how to lead an effective discussion about white fragility 
                with a white discussion group and provides helpful feedback for when they think the discussion may not apply to them, are hopeless, or expecting people of color to teach them about race.</p>
        <p>DiAngelo says it is important to keep this in mind: “The primary goal for white people working to understand racism is not to learn how racism impacts people of color. 
        The primary goal is to recognize how the system of racism shapes our lives, how we uphold that system, and how we might interrupt it.”</p>

            <p>How are our experiences of sysetmic opression shaped by how our identities intersect? Osman's text provides an accesible framework for understanding intersectionality aimed towards grades 7-12.
            There is no time more pertinent than the present moment to examine intersectionality with the rise of xenophobia, anti-immigrant rhetoric, and transphobia. As Osman says in the Introduction, "this is not a conversation
            anyone should get to opt out of, especially young people who are going to shape the future of the country and the world." </p>
