<!-- Implicit Bias Test -->
<main class="main-content">
    <section class="intro">
        <p>Implicit bias denotes the unconscious attitudes or stereotypes that affect our choices and interactions, frequently operating without our knowledge. 
            The Implicit Bias Test (IBT) serves to help individuals identify these concealed biases, fostering self-examination and awareness. 
            Intersectionality, a concept put forth by Kimberlé Crenshaw, underscores how intersecting identities—like race, gender, and class—result in intricate patterns of privilege and discrimination.</p>

        <h4>What is the Harvard IAT?</h4>
        <p>The Harvard IAT measures the strength of associations between concepts and stereotypes or judgements, like a strong association of “women” with “family” versus “men” with “career.” </p>
        <h4>Discussion:</h4>
        <p>The tool and the researchers that created it use the verbiage – “automatic preference”, to shift away from using the tool as a concrete way to determine implicit bias or racism. 
            At the time of this <a href="https://www.vox.com/identities/2017/3/7/14637626/implicit-association-test-racism">Vox</a> article, author German Lopez says there is “no clear disclaimer about how one shot at the test is likely meaningless for predicting an individual’s bias and behavior.” 
            When I recently took the IAT, it was clearly stated on the site that the test once does not accurately predict future behaviors. The usefulness of the IAT had shifted over time, 
            and many believe it hasn’t lived up to its promises. However, the activity prompts introspection on potential implicit biases that people may be unaware of, which, 
            even if not indicative of future behavior, is still helpful. </p>
